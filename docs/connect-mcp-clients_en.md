# Connecting MCP Clients (Kiro, Claude Code, Codex)

These clients need **only the MCP endpoint URL** — no Client Secret.
(Amazon Quick uses a separate shared-secret setup:
[quick-desktop-setup_en.md](quick-desktop-setup_en.md).)

## Setup

Add the following to your client's MCP configuration, replacing the URL with
your deploy output:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "feishu": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://d2ylo1bdfuock5.cloudfront.net/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Save → the client prompts to authorize → browser opens Feishu → approve → done.

On success the client loads 200+ Feishu tools. Tokens are cached locally and
refreshed automatically.

## Per-client notes

| Client | Notes | Docs |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Kiro** | IDE and CLI both supported | [kiro.dev/docs/mcp](https://kiro.dev/docs/mcp/) |
| **Claude Code** | `claude mcp add` generates the config above | [Remote MCP servers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#remote-mcp-connections) |
| **Codex** | CLI and Desktop App both supported | [Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/) |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Authorization page doesn't open | Check browser popup blocker; confirm network reaches the endpoint domain |
| "does not support dynamic client registration" | URL should be the `/mcp` endpoint, not `/authorize` |
| Custom URI scheme rejected (e.g. `cursor://`) | Only `https` and loopback `http` redirects are accepted |

<summary>Protocol details (debugging reference)</summary>

1. Client requests `/mcp` with no token → 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…"`.
2. Client fetches Protected Resource Metadata → finds the Authorization Server.
3. Client `POST /register` (RFC 7591 DCR) → receives an opaque `client_id`, no secret.
4. Authorization Code + PKCE flow; user approves in Feishu.
5. Client receives a Bearer token (30-day validity, per-user isolation).

<details>
<summary>ALLOWED_DOMAINS (no action needed for current clients)</summary>

Registration requires the redirect URI host to be in the allowlist. Loopback
(`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`) is always allowed — all current clients use loopback.

To add a non-loopback host in the future:
`EXTRA_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=<host> ./scripts/deploy.sh --yes`
