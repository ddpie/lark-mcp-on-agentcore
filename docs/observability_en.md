# Observability

## Overview

The system automatically creates comprehensive observability infrastructure during deployment: 10 CloudWatch alarms, 14 log MetricFilters (5 alarm-driving + 9 dashboard-only; the other 5 alarms use Lambda built-in metrics or `AWS/ApiGateway` 5XXError), a multi-section Dashboard, and optional Feishu group webhook alarm notifications. All observability data is designed around two core questions: **Can users access the service normally?** and **Are any tokens being lost?**

## Alarms (10)

All alarms connect to a single SNS Topic (`lark-mcp-on-agentcore-alarms`) that can simultaneously subscribe email, Feishu webhooks, PagerDuty, etc.

| # | Alarm Name | Metric Source | Default Threshold | Period | Eval Periods | Trigger Description |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | TokenLost | MetricFilter: `store_token_lost` | >= 1 | 60s | 1 | **Most severe**: refresh_token consumed but new token storage failed; user must re-authorize |
| 2 | RefreshFailed | MetricFilter: `refresh_cycle` ($.failed) | >= 3 | 300s | 1 | 3+ users failed refresh in a cycle (possible Feishu API issue) |
| 3 | OAuthErrors | Lambda built-in Errors metric (OAuth Lambda) | >= 5 | 300s | 2 | Uncaught exceptions in OAuth Lambda — code bug or dependency unavailable |
| 4 | MiddlewareErrors | Lambda built-in Errors metric (Middleware Lambda) | >= 5 | 300s | 2 | Uncaught exceptions in MCP middleware Lambda |
| 5 | McpLatencyP95 | MetricFilter: `McpLatencyMs` (p95) | >= 10000ms | 300s | 3 | MCP request P95 latency exceeds 10s — significant UX degradation |
| 6 | FeishuNotAuth | MetricFilter: `feishu_not_authorized` | >= 10 | 300s | 2 | Many users with invalid tokens — possible mass revocation or app config change |
| 7 | Concurrency | Lambda ConcurrentExecutions (Middleware) | >= 80% of quota (default 1000) | 60s | 3 | Lambda concurrency nearing limit; subsequent requests may be throttled. **Note:** threshold is computed against `LAMBDA_CONCURRENCY_QUOTA` env var (default 1000), not auto-detected from the account. If your account quota differs, set this env var before deploy |
| 8 | Throttles | Lambda Throttles (Middleware) | >= 1 | 300s | 1 | Throttling has occurred — user requests are being rejected |
| 9 | ApiGateway5xx | AWS/ApiGateway 5XXError | >= 5 | 300s | 2 | Gateway-level server errors (not Lambda errors; e.g., integration timeouts) |
| 10 | AgentCore5xx | MetricFilter: `agentcore_5xx` | >= 3 | 300s | 1 | AgentCore upstream returned 5xx — container issue or AWS service failure |

Alarms treat missing data as not breaching (`treatMissingData: NOT_BREACHING`), since absence of data points during low-traffic periods is expected behavior.

## MetricFilters (14)

All MetricFilters publish to namespace `LarkMcpOnAgentCore`. 5 of them drive alarms (marked "Alarm"); the other 9 are dashboard-only. **Note:** 5 additional alarms (OAuthErrors / MiddlewareErrors / Concurrency / Throttles / ApiGateway5xx) consume Lambda built-in metrics or the `AWS/ApiGateway` namespace and do **not** depend on a MetricFilter.

**Alarm-to-MetricFilter coupling:** McpLatencyAlarm and FeishuNotAuthAlarm reference their metrics by `namespace + metricName` strings (no explicit CDK dependency), whereas the other alarms call `filter.metric(...)` directly. If the corresponding MetricFilter is renamed or deleted without updating the alarm, the alarm will silently go blind — CloudFormation will not error, and CloudWatch will simply show Insufficient Data. When renaming McpLatencyFilter or FeishuNotAuthorizedFilter, always sync the alarm references.

| 5 | FeishuNotAuthorizedFilter | Middleware Lambda | `$.event = "feishu_not_authorized"` | FeishuNotAuthorized (count) | Alarm + Dashboard | Unauthorized request count (FeishuNotAuth alarm + Dashboard) |
| 6 | FeishuSlowFilter | OAuth Lambda | `$.event = "feishu_slow"` | FeishuSlow (count) | Dashboard | Feishu slow call count |

## Alarm Presets

Three presets available during deploy, selected via arrow keys:

| Alarm | Relaxed | Standard | Strict |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| token_lost | 3 | 1 | 1 |
| refresh_failed | 10 | 3 | 1 |
| oauth_errors | 20 | 5 | 2 |
| middleware_errors | 20 | 5 | 2 |
| mcp_latency (ms) | 20000 | 10000 | 5000 |
| feishu_not_auth | 30 | 10 | 5 |
| concurrency_pct (%) | 95 | 80 | 60 |
| throttles | 5 | 1 | 1 |
| apigw_5xx | 20 | 5 | 2 |
| upstream_5xx | 10 | 3 | 1 |

Preset definitions: `config/alarm-presets.json`

**Selection guidance:**
- **Relaxed**: Dev/test environments, or very few users. Tolerates occasional errors, avoids noisy alerts.
- **Standard**: Recommended for production. Balances sensitivity with noise.
- **Strict**: High service quality requirements. Any anomaly triggers immediate alarm; suitable for environments with on-call response teams.

## Custom Alarm Thresholds

Select "Custom" during deploy to adjust individual alarm thresholds:

1. System displays all alarms with current thresholds
2. Arrow keys to select an alarm to modify
3. Shows description and suggested range for that alarm
4. Enter new threshold value
5. Repeat until selecting "Done"

Custom values save to `.local/alarm-thresholds.json` (not committed, file permission 600). Subsequent `deploy.sh` runs detect existing customizations and ask whether to keep them.

Default thresholds in `config/alarm-thresholds.json` include:
- `threshold`: trigger value
- `period`: evaluation period (seconds)
- `evaluationPeriods`: consecutive breach count
- `unit` / `unit_en`: display unit
- `range`: suggested adjustment range

## Webhook Security

Alarm webhook supports two security verification methods (configured at deploy):

| Method | Mechanism | Config Key |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Signature | HMAC-SHA256(`"${timestamp}\n${secret}"`, "").base64 | ALARM_WEBHOOK_SECRET |
| Keyword | Message title includes `[keyword]` prefix | ALARM_WEBHOOK_KEYWORD |

**Signature verification flow:**
1. Lambda constructs `stringToSign = "${timestamp}\n${secret}"`
2. Computes `HMAC-SHA256(stringToSign, "")` and base64-encodes the result
3. Adds `timestamp` and `sign` to the request JSON at top level
4. Feishu webhook server performs the same computation with its configured secret and compares signatures

**Keyword verification flow:**
1. Message title is prefixed with `[keyword] `
2. Feishu checks that message content contains the keyword
3. Rejects messages that do not contain it

Both methods can be enabled simultaneously. Configuration persists in `.local/deploy-config`.

## Token Refresh Cycle

Runs every 30 minutes (EventBridge rate trigger), auto-renews when access_token has less than half its TTL remaining. After completion, emits structured log:

```json
{"event": "refresh_cycle", "refreshed": 5, "failed": 0, "skipped": 1, "total": 12}
```

The `total` field is published as the ActiveUsers metric on the Dashboard.
