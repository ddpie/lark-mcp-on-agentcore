# Smart Orchestration (Skill)

lark-cli's official Skills capture per-domain multi-step best practices (parameter formats, call order, preconditions), but they originally required the client to shell-exec lark-cli and read local md files — out of reach for remote MCP clients. This project rewrites them into pure-MCP form, loaded on demand via `lark_get_skill`, so remote clients can also read these best practices before acting.

## Example

"Schedule a product review tomorrow with the dev team, book a room, and create follow-up tasks"

The AI's execution:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Agent
    participant MCP as MCP Server

    U->>AI: Schedule product review, invite dev team, book room
    Note over AI,MCP: Load guides before acting
    AI->>MCP: lark_get_skill("calendar", "schedule-meeting")
    AI->>MCP: lark_get_skill("contact")
    Note over AI,MCP: Resolve attendees
    AI->>MCP: lark_contact_search_user("dev team")
    MCP-->>AI: open_id list
    Note over AI,MCP: Check availability
    AI->>MCP: lark_calendar_freebusy(start, end)
    MCP-->>AI: available slots
    Note over AI,MCP: Discover + invoke Tier2 tool
    AI->>MCP: lark_discover("calendar suggestion")
    AI->>MCP: lark_invoke("lark_calendar_suggestion", args)
    MCP-->>AI: candidate slots
    AI->>U: Here are available slots, which one?
    U->>AI: The second one
    Note over AI,MCP: Find room for confirmed slot
    AI->>MCP: lark_calendar_room_find(slot="confirmed")
    MCP-->>AI: available rooms
    AI->>U: These rooms are available, which one?
    U->>AI: 5F-Main
    Note over AI,MCP: Create event
    AI->>MCP: lark_calendar_create("Product Review", ...)
    MCP-->>AI: ✓ event created
    Note over AI,MCP: Load task Skill + create follow-up
    AI->>MCP: lark_get_skill("task")
    AI->>MCP: lark_task_create("Review follow-up", ...)
    MCP-->>AI: ✓ task created
    AI->>U: Done: event + room + follow-up task
```

Skills are loaded on demand via `lark_get_skill` — no fixed context cost.

## Maintenance

Skill files live in `docker/skills/`, transformed from lark-cli's official skills (see [bump-lark-cli](skills/bump-lark-cli.md) and [adapt-skill-for-mcp](skills/adapt-skill-for-mcp.md)). Re-adapt when upgrading lark-cli.
